If you want to develop with eclipse, do the following setup:

Use a new version of the Java EE Distribution of eclipse

copy ~/classpath to ~/.classpath - This way you have the required files in your project

Import Projects: openz  (Import / Existing Projects into Workspace)

Create a User-Library: In Window/Preferences/Java/BuildPath/User Librarys: OPenZLib,. Import all jars from ~/lib/runtime
Add this user-Lib to the Project  openz under Project - Properties - Java Build Path 

Create a (Tomcat) Server in Window / preferences / Runtime Environments

In the tray: Tab Server New Server

Add openz Project To the server:

In run / Run Configurations add  the following to Tomcat (x) - arguments / VM-Arguments : 

-Djava.awt.headless=true -Xms384M -Xmx1024M -XX:MaxPermSize=256M

(Also Dcatalina.home, Dcatalina.base, Dlog4j.configuration,  Djava.endorsed.dirs may be necessary here to start the server - These Arguments Depends on your environment)
